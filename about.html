        I own hundreds of unique writing pens! My mom and I even go to local pen shows every year together. Having 
        special pens is an easy conversation starter in meetings and interviews! I confess I probably need a support group
        for my pen cravings lol. <br> <br> "The pen is the tongue of the mind" ~Horace

        Water is my calming space...if I need to think, I find a lake or a fountain nearby. I love swimming, being 
        on jet skis, on a boat, taking a cruise, the list goes on! If only I drank as much water as I enjoyed it lol!

        A true girly girl inside! Not only do I enjoy walking around the mall for retail therapy, but I also love selling 
        and consignment. I resell my pre-loved handbags and other goodies on eBay, Poshmark and other locations. Helps to 
        turn my own trash into treasure.
